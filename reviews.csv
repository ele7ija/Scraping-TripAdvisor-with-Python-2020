The food was great, the spa was amazing and the hospitality from Stefan and the team was incredible. I'd definitely return."
September 2021,5,,Amazing stay at the Sheraton Novi Sad,"We enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Novi Sad. Even though we own a condo in very close proximity (my inlaws reside there) due to the Covid pandemic and the fact that both of us have to do some work at times, we decided to stay for the first week at the Sheraton Novi Sad.

August 2021,1,,Nonprofessional staff that steals customers,"Despite nice hotel, and the city , Sheraton service and stuff is not. Not only that the staff was rude , they also charged us for the service we did not use . We didn’t ask for late check out and yet they charged it. When we tried to ask why and contact the manager , the staff was rude and refusing to take responsibility. Very low level for the brand as Sheraton."
August 2021,5,,The best hotel in town,"It is located in a green area, not far from the old center. It is a pleasure to be greeted by a friendly and well-trained staff, closely supervised by the hotel manager. The hotel is well maintained, clean and with chic and spacious rooms. I noticed that they are very careful with the anti-covid rules. I recommend this hotel"
